5. Weight for weight

The weight of a number will be the sum of its digits.
For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1.
Need a string sort by the "weight" of these numbers.

function sum(number) {
  return number.toString().split('').reduce((acc, value) => acc + +value, 0);
}
function orderWeight(strng) {
  return strng.split(" ").sort((a,b) => sum(a) - sum(b) || a.localeCompare(b)).join(' ');
}
6. I work in the factory 3 years, my work relates to the support and developement software.
